{"name":"synapter","tagline":"Label-free data analysis pipeline for optimal identification and quantitation","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nThe `synapter` package provides functionality to re-analyse MSe label-free proteomics data acquired on a Waters Synapt Series mass spectrometer (and probably any Waters instrument). It allows to combine acquisitions that have been optimised for better identification (typically using ion mobility separation - HDMSe) and quantitation accuracy. It also allows to transfer identifications across multiple runs to reduce missing data across an experiment. \r\n\r\nThe analysis pipeline can be executed using a simple graphical user interface (started with `synapterGUI()`) or a high-level function `synergise` to produce a [html report](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/synapter/Report/index.html). Alternatively, or low-level interface is available (see `?Synapter`).\r\n\r\n### Help\r\n\r\n`synapter` comes with plenty of documentation. Have a start with the package documentation page `?synapter` and the vignette \r\n\r\n     vignette(\"synapter\", package=\"synapter\")\r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to contact [me](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/) for questions/comments/suggestions.\r\n\r\n### PLGS processing\r\n\r\nThe raw data files produced must first be processed by Water's PLGS software to produce `synapter` input files. This is described in details in the vignette. Additional information with lots of screenshots can be found in [these slides](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/synapter/PLGS_Data_Processing.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n`synapter` is available from the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) repository. The package and its dependencies can be installed with\r\n\r\n     source(\"http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\n     biocLite(\"synapter\")\r\n\r\nSee also the `synapter` [Bioconductor page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/synapter.html) for on-line access to the vignette and the reference manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe code on [github](https://github.com/lgatto/synapter/) is for sharing, testing, issue tracking and forking/pulling purposes. Although it should be in sync with the code on the [Bioconductor svn server](https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/), the latter is the official repository for the working source code. Get is with\r\n\r\n    svn co https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/rols\r\n\r\n(user name: `readonly`, password: `readonly`)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
